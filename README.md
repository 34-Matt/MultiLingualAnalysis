# MultiLingualAnalysis
Purpose of this repository is review the how various existing LLM's handle non-english text.

## Setup
Install python packages with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Afterwards, get a HuggingFace API key to gain access to restricted models.
Once the key is obtained, set it as an environment variable:
```bash
export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_token_here
```
